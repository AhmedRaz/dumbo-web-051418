# Object-Oriented JS

## Objectives
* Create objects as object literals or by instantiating them using new Object
* Add properties to store values (both primitive and non-primitive) on objects
* Write functions that use this and assign them as properties on objects
* Identify the differences between bind, call, and apply
* Use arrow functions to automatically bind context
* Create a class using both ES5 and ES6 syntaxes. In both syntaxes:
  * Write a constructor
  * Instantiate a new object
  * Create private "class" variables using the ES6 class syntax, closures, and IIFEs
  * Write instance methods for JS classes
  * Write class methods for JS classes (e.g. filters and search functions)

  class is object that delegates to other objects
  this is determined by how a function is called
  self is about how a method is defined, what object is receiving method call
